Introduction
Predicting flight fares accurately is a challenging task due to the many variables that impact pricing. The Flight Fare Prediction Analysis project uses historical flight fare data and machine learning techniques to provide users with a reliable estimation of flight ticket prices for their desired travel plans.

Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Utilizes historical flight fare data to generate well-informed fare predictions.
Multiple Algorithms: Evaluates various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective prediction model.
Parameter Customization: Allows users to tweak model parameters for personalized predictions.


Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Jupyter Notebook or preferred Python IDE
Required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-fare-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd flight-fare-prediction
Install the required dependencies.

Follow the instructions within the notebook to input travel details and receive accurate fare predictions.

Data Collection
The historical flight fare data used in this project is sourced from reputable databases and may include attributes such as departure city, arrival city, travel dates, airline, and fare prices.

Data Preprocessing
The collected data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, clean noisy data, and convert categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Selection
Several machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression, are evaluated to determine the optimal model for predicting flight fares.

Evaluation
The performance of the prediction models is evaluated using relevant metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
